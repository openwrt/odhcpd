odhcpd - Embedded DHCP/DHCPv6/RA Server & Relay

** Abstract **

odhcpd is a daemon for serving and relaying IP management protocols to
configure clients and downstream routers. It tries to follow the RFC 6204
requirements for IPv6 home routers.

odhcpd provides server services for DHCP, RA, stateless and stateful DHCPv6,
prefix delegation and can be used to relay RA, DHCPv6 and NDP between routed
(non-bridged) interfaces in case no delegated prefixes are available.


** Features **

1. Router Discovery support (solicitations and advertisements) with 2 modes
   server:	RD server for slave interfaces
   a) automatic detection of prefixes, delegated prefix and default routes, MTU
   b) automatic reannouncement when changes to prefixes or routes occur

   relay:	RD relay between master and slave interfaces
   a) support for rewriting announced DNS-server addresses in relay mode
   
2. DHCPv6-support with 2 modes of operation
   server: stateless, stateful and PD-server mode
   a) stateless and stateful address assignment
   b) prefix delegation support
   c) dynamic reconfiguration in case prefixes change
   d) hostname detection and hosts-file creation

   relay: 	mostly standards-compliant DHCPv6-relay
   a) support for rewriting announced DNS-server addresses
   
3. DHCPv4-support
   server: stateless and stateful mode

4. Proxy for Neighbor Discovery messages (solicitations and advertisements)
   a) support for auto-learning routes to the local routing table
   b) support for marking interfaces "external" not proxying NDP for them
      and only serving NDP for DAD and for traffic to the router itself
      [Warning: you should provide additional firewall rules for security]

5. IPv6 PxE Support.

** Compiling **

odhcpd uses cmake:
* To prepare a Makefile use:  "cmake ." 
* To build / install use: "make" / "make install" afterwards.
* To build DEB or RPM packages use: "make package" afterwards.


** Configuration **

odhcpd uses a UCI configuration file in /etc/config/dhcp for configuration
and may also receive information from ubus
